- Hamster Hotel

- I recreated a hotel website as close as possible, and I used many bootstrap components to make the website responsive for mobile and tablet devices

- Changes: 11/3/2023: After the peer review I added more media queries to apply the changes, like reducing the size of the logo, making the reservation button bigger, and making the run of the luxury wheel text smaller

- Peer Review: Raudel Alvarado - code runs evrything is smooth the only couple of things i notcied where on the bottom where you need to make a reservatrion the check availability tab is a different size than the others and is aligned different. also on the nav barwhen going into medium or small the collapse tab in ot all the way on the right and the logo is not all the way on the left.  it would look nicer as well if the logo was not as big as it is when in small .and the text for "run of the luxury wheel" as well. besides that great project and great work.
